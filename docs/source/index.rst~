   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to NEMO-RELOC's documentation!
======================================

There are two README.md files is this project. Their contents are loaded here and should describe the project (rather than have intro text duplicated in this index file). *It would have been better if the README.md files loaded their contents here without needing to click on a link. Like <INCLUDE=""> in HTML-speak. I don't know how to do this in Markdown)* **EDIT** I think a simple pre-"make html" command would be needed to paste in the contents of the README files.


`Include the root README.md file <../../../README.md>`_   

`Include the tools README.md file <../../../tools/README.md>`_   

Note however that the markdown in the README.md files is not converted into html with the ``make html`` rendering command.


Contents:

When a new note file is created manually add it to this list to aid finding it.
